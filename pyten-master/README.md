## What is PyTen? 

**PyTen** is a python package containing the state-of-the-art tensor decomposition and completion algorithms for “filling in the gaps”' of recovering high-order tensor-structured datasets characterized by noisy and missing information. It is developed by [`DATA Lab`](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html) and [`Info Lab`](http://infolab.tamu.edu) at Texas A&M University supported by the DARPA NGS2 HELIOS project.
